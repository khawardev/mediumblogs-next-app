    "sayings": "The easy path in social media is promoting the worst content, the cheapest, tackiest, lowest-effort stuff. That’s not what you get on Medium. You can actually find content you can build your brain with. I appreciate that, both as a reader and a writer.",

    "sayings": "For us tech folks, Medium membership unlocks a whole treasure trove of high-quality articles. One good technology book could sell for over the Medium membership fee amount. It’s your choice whether to buy one book, or buy hundreds and thousands of books by unlocking member-only reading on Medium. Investing in a Medium membership is one of the best investments I have ever made for my career.",
